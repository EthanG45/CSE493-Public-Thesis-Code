## 1.1. Section Details
The code in this section is a simple Xcode project. The files break out into generating a CRUD app that can be used on macOS, iPadOS, and iOS.

This app is heavily inspired by the fantastic Apple tutorial on [Building Lists and Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation) in SwiftUI.

## 1.2. Included Files
Open CSE493-CaseStudy-SwiftUI.xcodeproj in Xcode 13.1 or later. The Swift code can also be read in any text editor without SwiftUI previews.

## 1.3. Want to Read My Thesis?
My thesis will be published on the [ASU Barrett Thesis Collection](https://keep.lib.asu.edu/collections/130827) following its completion.
