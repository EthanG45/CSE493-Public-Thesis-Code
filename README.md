**Description:** This repository includes supporting code for my undergraduate Barrett thesis. My thesis is an exploratory research paper on the topic of SwiftUI vs UIKit.

## 1.2. Included Files
### 1.2.1. Section 1 SwiftUI Case Study Code
The case study code provides a simple Xcode project for demonstrating the rather simple SwiftUI methods for building a CRUD app capable of use on macOS, iPadOS, and iOS.

### 1.2.2. Section 2 SwiftUI Header Files
My paper discusses the SwiftUI header file and focuses on some snippets including the Text and Color View components.

### 1.2.3. Section 3 UIKit Header Files
My paper discusses the UIKit header files and focuses on some specific headers including the UILabel and UIColor components.

### 1.2.4. Section 4 SwiftUI Scraping Scripts
The scripts used for scraping SwiftUI usage on macOS and iOS are contained here. All credit to [Alexandre Colucci](https://blog.timac.org) for providing these resources.

### 1.2.5. Section 5 SwiftUI Usage Data macOS
This section includes all of the data I gathered on where SwiftUI is currently used in macOS Monterey 12.0.1.

### 1.2.6. Section 6 SwiftUI Usage Data iOS
This section includes all of the iOS data on where SwiftUI is used in iOS 13.1 and iOS 14.0. All credit to [Alexandre Colucci](https://blog.timac.org) for providing this data on his blog.

## 1.3. Want to Read My Thesis?
My thesis will be published on the [ASU Barrett Thesis Collection](https://keep.lib.asu.edu/collections/130827) following its completion.
