## 1.1. Section Details
The code in this section is from automatically generated header files for SwiftUI. I do not claim any ownership over these files.

## 1.2. Included Files
The entirety of Xcode 13.0's SwiftUI header has been included from [swiftui-changelog](https://github.com/twostraws/swiftui-changelog), but renamed to `swiftui-header.swift`.

The `color.swift` and `text.swift` are snippets cut and pasted out of the monolithic header file.

## 1.3. Want to Read My Thesis?
My thesis will be published on the [ASU Barrett Thesis Collection](https://keep.lib.asu.edu/collections/130827) following its completion.
