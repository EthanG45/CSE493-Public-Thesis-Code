## 1.1. Section Details
The code in this section is from automatically generated header files for UIKit. I do not claim any ownership over these files.

## 1.2. Included Files
The entirety of Xcode 13.1's UIKit header has been included from the Xcode files. It is renamed to `uikit-header.swift`.

The `uicolor.swift` and `uilabel.swift` are header files also taken from Xcode 13.1

## 1.3. Want to Read My Thesis?
My thesis will be published on the [ASU Barrett Thesis Collection](https://keep.lib.asu.edu/collections/130827) following its completion.
